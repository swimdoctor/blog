                Hi! I'm Dylan, a 2nd year Game Design and Development student here at RIT. I'm excited to
                learn about web design and it's applications for projects in websites and UI. I joined this major
                because of my continued interest in Game Development throughout high school and into college. I've
                worked on multiple personal game projects, as well as particpated in multiple Game Jams such as <a
                    href="ldjam.com">Ludum Dare</a> and the <a href="https://gamemakerstoolkit.com/jam/"> GMTK game
                    jam</a>. I have a huge interest in procedural generation and physics-based simulations, and a lot
                of my projects focus on these mechanics. I hope to continue to improve my skills in both coding and 
                learn more about procedural generation, and once I graduate I plan to work in the Game Design industry.
